Differential expression
=======================

Invoke :func:`crispyx.tl.rank_genes_groups` to compare perturbations
against the control population while matching the familiar
:func:`scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups` interface. Choose ``method="wilcoxon"`` (the
default) for a Mann-Whitney U test, ``method="wald"`` for the streaming Wald
test, or ``method="nb_glm"`` to fit DESeq2's negative binomial GLM
(:doc:`nb_glm`). The helper reuses the automatic control inference so a missing
``control_label`` triggers the same adaptive search used earlier, and the
returned :class:`cx.AnnData` wrapper stores previews of the results in
``.uns`` so printing ``adata.uns["rank_genes_groups"]`` shows the top genes
per perturbation while ``.load()`` retrieves the full tables on demand.

Scanpy-compatible parameter aliases
-----------------------------------

All three DE functions (:func:`crispyx.tl.t_test`, :func:`crispyx.tl.wilcoxon_test`,
:func:`crispyx.tl.nb_glm_test`) and :func:`crispyx.tl.rank_genes_groups` accept
the Scanpy-style aliases ``groupby`` (for ``perturbation_column``) and
``reference`` (for ``control_label``), making it easier to port code from
Scanpy workflows:

.. code-block:: python

   # Scanpy-style call (aliases)
   result = cx.tl.rank_genes_groups(
       adata_ro,
       groupby="perturbation",   # alias for perturbation_column
       reference="ctrl",         # alias for control_label
       method="wilcoxon",
   )

   # Equivalent canonical call
   result = cx.tl.rank_genes_groups(
       adata_ro,
       perturbation_column="perturbation",
       control_label="ctrl",
       method="wilcoxon",
   )

The canonical names (``perturbation_column`` and ``control_label``) remain the
primary names and are not deprecated. Supplying both a canonical name and its
alias at the same time raises ``TypeError``.

Batch-stratified Wilcoxon (van Elteren test)
--------------------------------------------

When cells come from multiple batches (e.g. 10x lanes, gem-groups, or
experimental replicates), a pooled Wilcoxon test can suffer from rank
inflation: cells from a high-count batch will systematically receive higher
ranks, creating spurious hits correlated with batch rather than perturbation.

Pass ``batch_column`` to perform a **batch-stratified (van Elteren) Wilcoxon**
test instead: cells are ranked *within each batch separately* and the
per-stratum U statistics are summed, removing batch-driven rank inflation.

.. code-block:: python

   result = cx.tl.wilcoxon_test(
       adata_csc,
       perturbation_column="perturbation",
       batch_column="batch",          # column in adata.obs
   )

Key properties:

* Low-expression filtering, log-fold changes, and ``pts`` remain pooled across
  all cells — only the rank test is stratified.
* Perturbations that share no batch with any control cell are automatically
  marked untestable (NaN p-values) and logged.
* Diagnostic metadata stored in ``uns``: ``stratified_n_batches``,
  ``stratified_n_control_batches``, ``stratified_n_untestable_perturbations``,
  ``stratified_min_shared_batches_per_perturbation``, and
  ``stratified_median_shared_batches_per_perturbation``.
* The output file receives the suffix ``_cx_wilcoxon_stratified.h5ad`` to
  distinguish it from the pooled result.

For effect sizes and standard errors to go with the stratified p-values, and how
this compares with the other ways of adjusting for batches, see
:doc:`covariate_adjustment`.

Genes expressed in few cells
----------------------------

The Wilcoxon p-value is, by default, Scanpy's normal approximation. It fails
for a gene that few cells express: almost every value is tied at zero, the
count of expressing cells that fall in the group is hypergeometric and very
skewed, and the normal tail is far too thin. On a simulated group of 60
cells against 3,000 controls:

==========================================  ========  ==============  ===========
Expressing cells (group / controls)         normal    hypergeometric  permutation
==========================================  ========  ==============  ===========
1 / 3                                       9.0e-04   7.0e-02         7.6e-02
2 / 3                                       8.3e-10   1.4e-03         2.1e-03
3 / 20                                      1.2e-04   4.9e-03         6.1e-03
4 / 60                                      1.3e-02   2.7e-02         2.8e-02
==========================================  ========  ==============  ===========

So groups made of control cells get as many significant genes as real
perturbations. A filter on expressing cells does not cure it: three cells of
a group against 20 controls still gets p 1e-4 rather than 6e-3.
``distribution="hypergeometric"`` keeps that count's exact distribution in
each stratum, with the rank sum given the count normal, and comes within a
factor of about 1.5 of the permutation p-value, pooled or with
``batch_column``:

.. code-block:: python

   result = cx.tl.wilcoxon_test(
       "screen_csc.h5ad", perturbation_column="perturbation", control_label="control",
       distribution="hypergeometric",
   )

It changes the p-value only where the count's variance, summed over strata,
is below 100, and leaves ``z_score`` and the AUC as they are. It costs
nothing on the pooled test and about twice the rank-test time with
``batch_column``. The default stays ``"normal"``, which matches Scanpy.

Permutation nulls without copying the data
------------------------------------------

``wilcoxon_test`` also takes the labels themselves as a ``pd.Series`` indexed
by cell, so a label-permutation null needs no relabelled copy of the file:

.. code-block:: python

   labels = cx.load_obs("screen_csc.h5ad")["perturbation"]
   rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
   for i in range(100):
       shuffled = pd.Series(rng.permutation(labels.to_numpy()), index=labels.index, name="shuffle")
       null = cx.tl.wilcoxon_test(
           "screen_csc.h5ad", perturbation_column=shuffled, control_label="control",
           output_path=f"null/shuffle_{i}.h5ad",
       )

The Series is aligned to ``obs_names`` by its index and needs a label for
every cell; its ``name`` names the column in the result. Each shuffle is a
different call, so a result at a fixed ``output_path`` is recomputed for a new
Series and reused for the same one. Convert a CSR file to CSC once beforehand
(:func:`crispyx.convert_to_csc`): otherwise every call makes its own temporary
CSC copy.

Differential expression visualization
-------------------------------------

The plotting functions (``cx.pl``) work on on-disk results: they materialise
only the metadata they need and keep the expression matrix on disk.

.. code-block:: python

   # Rank genes groups plot (Scanpy-style)
   cx.pl.rank_genes_groups(adata_de, n_genes=20, sharey=False)

   # Convert DE results into a tidy DataFrame for custom plots
   df = cx.pl.rank_genes_groups_df(adata_de, group="perturbation_A", n_genes=200)

   # Volcano and top-genes plots
   cx.pl.volcano(de_df=df, group="perturbation_A")
   cx.pl.top_genes_bar(de_df=df, group="perturbation_A", topn=15)

   # MA plot using raw counts or normalized log1p means
   cx.pl.ma(
       data=adata_ro,  # raw counts
       de_result=adata_de,
       group="perturbation_A",
       reference="control",
       perturbation_column="perturbation",
       mean_mode="raw",  # or "log1p"
   )
